## Approach

* Firstly, I collected the data from here: https://bit.ly/3X381ok

* Data Cleaning: Now, I explored the data and checked the null values, duplicate values, and values are in the correct format or not. I found out some columns' value is not in the correct format. so, I fixed that.

* Then, I analyzed the data and find meaningful insight, and at the end, I created a report
